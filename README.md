=====================
<span style="color:red">

### Important Support Note
</span>

***Worldpay provides SDK updates for releases in the latest major version stream. We do not provide SDK updates to older releases, unless mandated by the card brands. All SDKs are open source, allowing you to update older versions as needed.***


#### WARNING:
##### All major version changes require recertification to the new version. Once certified for the use of a new version, Vantiv modifies your Merchant Profile, allowing you to submit transaction to the Production Environment using the new version. Updating your code without recertification and modification of your Merchant Profile will result in transaction declines. Please consult you Implementation Analyst for additional information about this process.

Setup
-----

1.) To install it, just copy LitleSdkForDotNet.dll into your Visual Studio references. 

2.) You can configure it statically by modifying LitleSdkForDotNet.dll.config or at runtime using the LitleOnline(Dictionary) constructor. If you are just trying it out, the username, password and merchant id don't matter, and you should choose the sandbox url at https://www.testvantivcnp.com/sandbox/communicator/online.

3.) Create a C# class similar to:  

```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using Litle.Sdk;

    class Example
    {
[STAThread]
        public static void Main(String[] args)
        {
            LitleOnline litle = new LitleOnline();
            sale sale = new sale();
            sale.orderId = "1";
            sale.id = "1";
            sale.amount = 10010;
            sale.orderSource = orderSourceType.ecommerce;
            contact contact = new contact();
            contact.name = "John Smith";
            contact.addressLine1 = "1 Main St.";
            contact.city = "Burlington";
            contact.state = "MA";
            contact.zip = "01803-3747";
            contact.country = countryTypeEnum.US;
            sale.billToAddress = contact;
            cardType card = new cardType();
            card.type = methodOfPaymentTypeEnum.VI;
            card.number = "4457010000000009";
            card.expDate = "0112";
            card.cardValidationNum = "349";
            sale.card = card;

            saleResponse response = litle.Sale(sale);
            //Display Results
            Console.WriteLine("Response: " + response.response);
            Console.WriteLine("Message: " + response.message);
            Console.WriteLine("Litle Transaction Id: " + response.litleTxnId);
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }

```
